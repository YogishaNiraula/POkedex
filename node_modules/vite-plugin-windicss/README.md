## Features

- ‚ö°Ô∏è **It's FAST** - 20~100x times faster than Tailwind on Vite
- üß© On-demand CSS utilities (Fully compatible with Tailwind CSS v2)
- üì¶ On-demand native elements style reseting (preflight)
- üî• Hot module replacement (HMR)
- üçÉ Load configurations from `tailwind.config.js`
- ü§ù Framework-agnostic - Vue, React, Svelte and vanilla!
- üìÑ CSS `@apply` / `@screen` directives transforms (also works for Vue SFC's `<style>`)
- üé≥ Support Variant Groups - e.g. `bg-gray-200 hover:(bg-gray-100 text-red-300)`
- üòé ["Design in Devtools"](#design-in-devtools) - if you work this way in the traditional Tailwind, no reason we can't!

## Install

```bash
npm i -D vite-plugin-windicss windicss
# or
yarn add -D vite-plugin-windicss windicss
```

```ts
// vite.config.js
import WindiCSS from 'vite-plugin-windicss'

export default {
  plugins: [
    WindiCSS()
  ],
};
```

```ts
// main.js
import 'virtual:windi.css'
```

That's all. Build your app just like what you would do with Tailwind CSS, but much faster! ‚ö°Ô∏è

## Migration from Tailwind CSS

If you are already using Tailwind CSS for your Vite app, you can follow these instructions to migrate your installation.

### `package.json`

Some of your dependencies are no longer required, you can remove them if they were only needed for Tailwind CSS.

```diff
- "tailwindcss": "*",
- "postcss": "*",
- "autoprefixer": "*",
+ "vite-plugin-windicss": "*"
```

### `tailwind.config.js`

All `variants` are enabled, since the overhead they caused is fixed by Windi's on-demand nature. `purge` is no longer needed as well. `colors` and `plugins` imports need to be renamed to `windicss` instead.

```diff
-const colors = require('tailwindcss/colors')
+const colors = require('windicss/colors')
-const typography = require('@tailwindcss/typography')
+const typography = require('windicss/plugin/typography')

module.exports = {
- purge: {
-   content: [
-     './**/*.html',
-   ],
-   options: {
-     safelist: ['prose', 'prose-sm', 'm-auto'],
-   },
- },
- variants: {
-   extend: {
-     cursor: ['disabled'],
-   }
- },
  darkMode: 'class',
  plugins: [typography],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        teal: colors.teal,
      },
    }
  },
}
```

### `vite.config.js`

Add this plugin into your configuration.

```ts
// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import WindiCSS from 'vite-plugin-windicss'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    WindiCSS()
  ]
})
```

### `main.js`

Import `@virtual/windi.css` in your code entry.

```ts
import 'virtual:windi.css'
```

### `main.css`

You can now remove the Tailwind imports from your css entry.

```diff
- @import 'tailwindcss/base';
- @import 'tailwindcss/components';
- @import 'tailwindcss/utilities';
```

### Cleanup (optional)

The following files can be removed if you don't use their other features.

```diff
- postcss.config.js
```

### All set.

That's all, fire up Vite and enjoy the speed!

## Supports

### TypeScript

Enable TypeScript for your `tailwind.config.js`? Sure, why not?

Rename it to `tailwind.config.ts` and things will just work!

```ts
// tailwind.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'windicss/helpers'
import formsPlugin from 'windicss/plugin/forms'

export default defineConfig({
  darkMode: 'class',
  safelist: 'p-3 p-4 p-5',
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        teal: {
          100: '#096',
        },
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [formsPlugin],
})
```

### Pug Support

It will automatically enable Pug support for `.pug` and Vue SFC when dependency `pug` is found in the workspace.

### "Design in DevTools"

> ‚öóÔ∏è Experimental

It might be a common practice when you use the purge-based Tailwind where you have all the classes in your browser and you can try how things work by directly changing the classes in DevTools. While you might think this is some kind of limitation of "on-demand" where the DevTools don't know those you haven't used in your source code yet.

But unfortunately, **we are here to BREAK the limitation** üòé See the [video demo](https://twitter.com/antfu7/status/1372244287975387145).

Just add the following line to your main entry

```js
import 'virtual:windi-devtools'
```

It will be enabled automatically for you, have fun!

Oh and don't worry about the final bundle, in production build `virtual:windi-devtools` will be an empty module and you don't have to do anything about it :)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Please use it with caution, under the hood we use [MutationObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) to detect the class changes. Which means not only your manual changes but also the changes made by your scripts will be detected and included in the stylesheet. This could cause some misalignment between dev and the production build when **using dynamically constructed classes** (false-positive). We recommended adding your dynamic parts to the `safelist` or setup UI regression tests for your production build if possible.

## Configuration

### Preflight (style reseting)

Preflight is enabled on-demanded, if you'd like to completely disable it, you can configure it as below

```ts
// windi.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite-plugin-windicss'

export default defineConfig({
  preflight: false
})
```

### Safelist

By default, we scan your source code statically and find all the usages of the utilities then generated corresponding CSS on-demand. However, there is some limitation that utilities that decided in the runtime can not be matched efficiently, for example

```tsx
<!-- will not be detected -->
<div className={`p-${size}`}>
```

For that, you will need to specify the possible combinations in the `safelist` options of `vite.config.js`.

```ts
// windi.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite-plugin-windicss'

export default defineConfig({
  safelist: 'p-1 p-2 p-3 p-4'
})
```

Or you can do it this way

```ts
// windi.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite-plugin-windicss'

function range(size, startAt = 1) {
  return Array.from(Array(size).keys()).map(i => i + startAt);
}

export default defineConfig({
  safelist: [
    range(30).map(i => `p-${i}`), // p-1 to p-3
    range(10).map(i => `mt-${i}`) // mt-1 to mt-10
  ]
})
```

### Scanning

On server start, `vite-plugin-windicss` will scan your source code and extract the utilities usages. By default,
only files under `src/` with extensions `vue, html, mdx, pug, jsx, tsx` will be included. If you want to enable scaning for other file type of locations, you can configure it via:

```ts
// windi.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'windicss/helpers'

export default defineConfig({
  extract: {
    include: ['src/**/*.{vue,html,jsx,tsx}'], 
    exclude: ['node_modules', '.git']
  }
})
```

Or in plugin options:

```ts
// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    WindiCSS({
      scan: {
        dirs: ['.'], // all files in the cwd
        fileExtensions: ['vue', 'js', 'ts'], // also enabled scanning for js/ts
      },
    }),
  ],
})
```


### Layers Ordering

> Supported from v0.14.x

By default, importing `virtual:windi.css` will imports all the three layers with the order `base - components - utilities`. If you want to have better controls over the orders, you can separate them by:

```diff
- import 'virtual:windi.css'
+ import 'virtual:windi-base.css'
+ import 'virtual:windi-components.css'
+ import 'virtual:windi-utilities.css'
```

You can also make your custom css been able to be override by certain layers:

```diff
  import 'virtual:windi-base.css'
  import 'virtual:windi-components.css'
+ import './my-style.css'
  import 'virtual:windi-utilities.css'
```

### More

See [options.ts](https://github.com/windicss/vite-plugin-windicss/blob/main/packages/plugin-utils/src/options.ts) for more configuration reference.

## Caveats

### Scoped Style

You will need to **set `transformCSS: 'pre'` to get Scoped Style work**.

`@media` directive with scoped style can **only works** with `css` `postcss` `scss` but not `sass`, `less` nor `stylus`

## Example

See [./examples](./examples) for *react*, *vue* and *vue with pug* sample projects, or [`Vitesse`](https://github.com/antfu/vitesse)
